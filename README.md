## Project Title: School District Performance Analysis

### Background

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I have been tasked with providing insightful data analysis to aid the school board and the mayor in making informed strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. My initial project involves an in-depth analysis of district-wide standardized test results to identify trends in school performance.

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **District Summary**: Create a comprehensive overview of the district's key educational metrics.
2. **School Summary**: Provide detailed performance metrics for each school in the district.
3. **Identify High and Low Performers**: Highlight the highest and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
4. **Grade-Level Performance**: Analyze average math and reading scores by grade level.
5. **Performance by Spending**: Examine how school spending impacts performance.
6. **Performance by School Size**: Analyze performance metrics based on school size.
7. **Performance by School Type**: Compare performance across different types of schools (e.g., charter, public).

### Data Analysis and Methodology

#### District Summary

A DataFrame summarizing the district’s key metrics will be created, including:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage passing math
- Percentage passing reading
- Overall passing percentage (students passing both math and reading)

#### School Summary

Each school’s performance metrics will be calculated and presented in a DataFrame with the following details:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage passing math
- Percentage passing reading
- Overall passing percentage

#### Highest and Lowest Performing Schools

- **Top Performing Schools**: Identify and display the top 5 schools based on overall passing rates.
- **Bottom Performing Schools**: Identify and display the bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rates.

#### Performance by Grade Level

Create DataFrames to analyze the average scores for math and reading by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) for each school.

#### Scores by School Spending

Analyze the relationship between school spending and performance. Schools will be grouped into spending ranges:
- <$585
- $585-630
- $630-645
- $645-680

Key metrics for each spending range will be calculated:
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage passing math
- Percentage passing reading
- Overall passing percentage

#### Scores by School Size

Examine how school size affects performance by categorizing schools into three size categories:
- Small (<1000 students)
- Medium (1000-2000 students)
- Large (2000-5000 students)

#### Scores by School Type

Compare performance metrics based on school types (e.g., charter, public) to understand how different school models impact student outcomes.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Sources**: District-wide standardized test results, school budget data

### Conclusion

This project will provide the school district with a comprehensive analysis of school performance, highlighting key trends and insights that can inform future budgetary and strategic decisions. By leveraging data-driven insights, the school district can enhance educational outcomes and resource allocation effectively.

### Future Work

Future analyses could expand to include:
- Longitudinal studies tracking performance over multiple years
- Additional metrics such as student demographic data, teacher-student ratios, and extracurricular participation
- Predictive modeling to forecast future performance based on current trends
